[**Note-Taker**](https://github.com/ryanbrowne360/Note-Taker.git)

Description:

For this project, I was responsible for making an application that can make, edit, and delete notes.

Installation:

Must have node.js installed. Then must run node server.js in termminal in the Note-Taker directory.


Usage:

The application is designed so that the user can title and write a note, save it to review or edit later, and also to delete on that is already made. It uses the express package to do api calls to connect the user with the relevant capabailities.
